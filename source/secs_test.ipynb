    "## What are Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "SECS is a mathematical method used to analyze and visualize ionospheric currents and their associated magnetic fields. The method works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up a grid of elementary current systems** in the ionosphere (about 110 km above Earth's surface)\n",
    "2. **Measuring magnetic field variations** at ground-based magnetometer stations\n",
    "3. **Solving an inverse problem** to find the current amplitudes that best explain the observed magnetic fields\n",
    "4. **Calculating the resulting magnetic field** at any location using the estimated currents\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to create a continuous map of magnetic field variations over a region, even in areas without direct measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem is mathematically challenging because it's underdetermined (more unknowns than measurements) and requires regularization techniques to obtain physically meaningful solutions."

    "   - **L0 regularization** (amplitude damping): Penalizes large current amplitudes\n",
    "   - **L1 regularization** (smoothness): Penalizes rapid spatial variations in the current pattern\n",
