    "## What are Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "SECS is a mathematical method used to analyze and visualize ionospheric currents and their associated magnetic fields. The method works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up a grid of elementary current systems** in the ionosphere (about 110 km above Earth's surface)\n",
    "2. **Measuring magnetic field variations** at ground-based magnetometer stations\n",
    "3. **Solving an inverse problem** to find the current amplitudes that best explain the observed magnetic fields\n",
    "4. **Calculating the resulting magnetic field** at any location using the estimated currents\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to create a continuous map of magnetic field variations over a region, even in areas without direct measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem is mathematically challenging because it's underdetermined (more unknowns than measurements) and requires regularization techniques to obtain physically meaningful solutions."

    "The SECS inversion process we just ran involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Loading magnetometer data for X, Y, Z components\n",
    "   - Filtering stations to keep only those with valid coordinates\n",
    "   - Applying time averaging to smooth the data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Setup**:\n",
    "   - Creating a cubed-sphere grid centered at our region of interest\n",
    "   - The grid defines where the elementary current systems are placed\n",
    "   - Each grid point represents a potential current source\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SECS Basis Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Computing how each elementary current affects the magnetic field at each station\n",
    "   - These \"basis functions\" form the forward model (G matrix)\n",
    "   - The mirror method accounts for currents induced in the Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inverse Problem Solution**:\n",
    "   - For each timestamp, we solve the inverse problem: G * I = B\n",
    "   - G is the forward model matrix\n",
    "   - I is the vector of current amplitudes (what we're solving for)\n",
    "   - B is the vector of observed magnetic field values\n",
    "   - Regularization (l0 and l1) helps stabilize the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Field Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Once we have the current amplitudes, we calculate the resulting magnetic field\n",
    "   - This gives us a continuous map of the magnetic field over the entire grid\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a set of magnetic field components (Be, Bn, Bu) for each timestamp, which we'll visualize in the next sections."

    "- A color map showing the vertical magnetic field component (Bu)\n",
    "- Black arrows showing the SECS-predicted horizontal field (Be, Bn)\n",

     "While the comparison plots in Section 3 provide an intuitive visualization for human interpretation, we also need a representation that's suitable for machine learning applications. The RGB visualization technique encodes the three magnetic field components (Be, Bn, Bu) as color channels in a single image, creating a compact representation that's ideal for training neural networks.\n",

     "This approach is particularly valuable for developing time-dependent models like convolutional LSTMs that can forecast magnetic field evolution based on solar wind parameters and other geophysical inputs. The RGB mapping is as follows:\n",

This standardized format preserves the spatial relationships and vector information in a form that's readily processable by convolutional neural networks."
