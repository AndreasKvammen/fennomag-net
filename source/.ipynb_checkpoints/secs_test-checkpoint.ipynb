    "## What are Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "SECS is a mathematical method used to analyze and visualize ionospheric currents and their associated magnetic fields. The method works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up a grid of elementary current systems** in the ionosphere (about 110 km above Earth's surface)\n",
    "2. **Measuring magnetic field variations** at ground-based magnetometer stations\n",
    "3. **Solving an inverse problem** to find the current amplitudes that best explain the observed magnetic fields\n",
    "4. **Calculating the resulting magnetic field** at any location using the estimated currents\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to create a continuous map of magnetic field variations over a region, even in areas without direct measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem is mathematically challenging because it's underdetermined (more unknowns than measurements) and requires regularization techniques to obtain physically meaningful solutions."

    "\n",
    "When analyzing the SECS results, look for these key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Patterns**:\n",
    "   - **Vortex structures**: Circular patterns in the horizontal field (arrows) often indicate field-aligned currents\n",
    "   - **Parallel flows**: Aligned arrows indicate sheet currents\n",
    "   - **Boundaries**: Sharp transitions in color or arrow direction may indicate boundaries between different current systems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal Evolution**:\n",
    "   - How patterns change over the 45-minute period\n",
    "   - Whether features move, intensify, or dissipate\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - Compare blue arrows (observations) with black arrows (predictions)\n",
    "   - Good alignment indicates the model is capturing the actual current systems\n",
    "   - Discrepancies may indicate limitations in the model or data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **Eastward electrojet**: Strong east-west aligned currents (visible as north-south magnetic field)\n",
    "   - **Westward electrojet**: Opposite of eastward electrojet\n",
    "   - **Field-aligned currents**: Often visible as vortex structures\n",

    "### Common Features in SECS Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common features you might observe in the visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Auroral Electrojets**:\n",
    "   - Strong east-west aligned currents in the auroral zone\n",
    "   - Visible as predominantly red or cyan bands in the RGB visualization\n",
    "   - In comparison plots, they appear as parallel arrows with strong vertical field (color) boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Field-Aligned Currents (FACs)**:\n",
    "   - Connect the ionosphere to the magnetosphere\n",
    "   - Appear as vortex structures in the horizontal field\n",
    "   - Often occur in pairs (upward and downward currents)\n",
    "   - In RGB visualization, they often appear as circular features with color transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Substorm Features**:\n",
    "   - Rapid intensifications of currents\n",
    "   - Westward traveling surge (a characteristic feature during substorms)\n",
    "   - Expansion and contraction of the auroral oval\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quiet-Time Patterns**:\n",
    "   - Weaker, more stable current systems\n",
    "   - Less dramatic color variations in RGB visualization\n",
    "   - Smoother, more organized arrow patterns in comparison plots"

    "### Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting these results, keep in mind several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Station Coverage**:\n",
    "   - The accuracy of the SECS model depends on the number and distribution of magnetometer stations\n",
    "   - Areas far from stations have less reliable results\n",
    "   - The blue dots in comparison plots show where actual measurements exist\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization Effects**:\n",
    "   - The regularization parameters (l0 and l1) affect the solution\n",
    "   - Too much regularization: Overly smooth, may miss real features\n",
    "   - Too little regularization: Noisy, may show artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ground Induction**:\n",
    "   - The mirror method (mirror_depth parameter) attempts to account for currents induced in the Earth\n",
    "   - This is an approximation and may not fully capture complex conductivity structures\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ionospheric Height**:\n",
    "   - The SECS model assumes currents flow at a fixed height (typically 110 km)\n",
    "   - In reality, currents flow at various heights\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Resolution**:\n",
    "   - Our 5-minute time steps may miss rapid variations\n",
    "   - Some features may evolve faster than our sampling rate"

    "1. **SECS Inversion**: Calculating ionospheric currents from ground magnetometer data\n",
    "2. **Comparison Visualization**: Evaluating the model against observations\n",
    "3. **RGB Visualization**: Compactly representing all three magnetic field components\n",
    "\n",
    "The SECS method provides a powerful tool for studying ionospheric currents and their associated magnetic fields. By solving the inverse problem with appropriate regularization, we can create continuous maps of magnetic field variations even in regions without direct measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two visualization approaches offer complementary insights:\n",
    "- **Comparison plots** help evaluate model accuracy and show the vector nature of the field\n",
    "- **RGB visualization** provides a compact representation that can reveal patterns not obvious in individual components\n",

    "1. **Try different parameters**:\n",
    "   - Adjust regularization parameters (l0, l1) to see how they affect the solution\n",
    "   - Change the grid resolution or size\n",
    "   - Modify the mirror depth to see how it affects the results\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze different time periods**:\n",
    "   - Compare quiet and disturbed geomagnetic conditions\n",
    "   - Look at substorm onset and recovery phases\n",
    "   - Examine seasonal or diurnal variations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced analysis**:\n",
    "   - Calculate derived quantities like divergence-free and curl-free components\n",
    "   - Estimate field-aligned current densities\n",
    "   - Compare with satellite observations or auroral images\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization enhancements**:\n",
    "   - Create animations to better show temporal evolution\n",
    "   - Add geographic features for better context\n",
